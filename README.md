## Running Segrada

You need Java 8 JRE installed. Later versions will not work with Segrada.

In order to try out Segrada, download the program and unpack it to a folder of your choice.  
On Windows, start the application with Segrada.exe. On Linux, Unix, and Apple Mac OS, run start.sh (you might have to make this file executable).

The application runs in your browser. You can stop the application by clicking "Stop" in the control window or by closing it.
